Simple demo for scoring sustainability of a product image using the OpenAI API.
It uses the `gpt-4o-mini` model, which supports vision input.

Open `index.html` in a browser. Provide your OpenAI API key, upload an image and
click **Score product**. If no API key is entered, a mock score and
description are returned for easy testing. Otherwise, the request is sent to the
OpenAI API and the result is shown on the page.
